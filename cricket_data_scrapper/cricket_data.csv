18.6,"18.6 Mukesh Kumar to Wade, 1 run, direct hit would have been curtains for Matthew Wade, not to be.

17.3,"17.3 Avesh Khan to Dwarshuis, out Bowled!! The off pole goes cartwheeling. Avesh Khan does not want to celebrate. He might be still thinking about that first delivery?

16.1,"16.1 Chahar to Matthew Short, 2 runs, tough catch and Mukesh fails to get a hand on it. Seam-up short delivery outside off, Short pulls and a top-edge sails to the right of short fine.

Philippe b Ravi Bishnoi 8(7) [4s-2]"
2.6,"2.6 Chahar to Head, FOUR, 22 off the over. Now Chahar angles it in from round the wicket, lands it around leg-stump and that's once again easy pickings for Head, he flicks it aerially and clears mid-wicket comfortably"
2.5,"2.5 Chahar to Head, FOUR, Chahar being taken apart. 18 runs already from the over. The change to round the wicket does not help him keep Head quiet. Offers width outside off and Head does not hold back, throws everything behind the lofted shot and sends it sailing over extra cover"

19.6,"19.6 Behrendorff to Ravi Bishnoi, wide, Wade saves a few for his team. Horrible delivery from Behrendorff, way down leg and it needed a full dive from Wade to just parry the ball to short fine. Avesh wanted a single but Bishnoi sends him back"

19.3,"19.3 Behrendorff to Chahar, out Caught by Chris Green!! Another batter bites the dust looking for quick runs. India have lost 4 wickets in the last 9 balls.

Chahar c Chris Green b Behrendorff 0(2)"
19.2,"19.2 Behrendorff to Ravi Bishnoi, 1 run, full toss around leg, Bishnoi mistimes the heave to deep mid-wicket"
19.1,"19.1 Behrendorff to Rinku Singh, out Lbw!! That looked more out on first instance than it did on ball-tracker. Rinku departs but does not waste a review. India losing their way a bit towards the end. This was the yorker from Behrendorff and Rinku fails to get his bat down to keep it out, struck low on the pad and right in front of the stumps, ball-tracking showed it to be just brushing leg-stump. Rinku is disappointed but has to walk back. Rinku Singh lbw b Behrendorff 46(29) [4s-4 6s-2]"
18.6,"18.6 Dwarshuis to Chahar, no run, excellent over from Dwarshuis, 7 runs and 2 wickets. Back of a length delivery angled across, Chahar has a tentative poke and is beaten on the outside edge. He was looking to steer it to third man"

18.4,"18.4 Dwarshuis to Jitesh Sharma, out Caught by Head!! That's a good take by Head. But Jitesh would be disappointed as this was not a wicket-taking delivery - high full toss outside off, Jitesh goes for the big swing down the ground and the bat turns on impact, he miscues it towards long-off and Head takes a well-judged catch just in front of the rope. A handy knock from Jitesh comes to an end. He gave India the much needed impetus after Gaikwad's departure. Jitesh Sharma c Head b Dwarshuis 35(19) [4s-1 6s-3]"
18.3,"18.3 Dwarshuis to Jitesh Sharma, 2 runs, very full and outside off, Jitesh shuffles and scoops it over extra over, couple more"
18.2,"18.2 Dwarshuis to Jitesh Sharma, FOUR, slower ball outside off, Jitesh stays deep in the crease and bashes it past extra cover. He delayed his bat swing a touch and hence could generate the power"

17.1,"17.1 Behrendorff to Rinku Singh, FOUR, streaky! Not where Rinku intended but he gets the boundary. He wanted to lap it round the corner into the leg-side but ends up getting a top-edge, the ball flies over Wade and races away.."
16.6,"16.6 Hardie to Jitesh Sharma, SIX, turns into a good over for India. Hardie misses his radar with the short of length delivery, around leg-stump and Jitesh gets inside the line, pulls it Calypso style over fine leg"
